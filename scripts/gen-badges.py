Generate shields.io endpoint-badge JSON from repo state, so the README badges
never drift as missions and tests are added.

Writes:
  docs/assets/badges/missions.json  — count of skills/<name>/ mission dirs
  docs/assets/badges/tests.json     — source inventory of `def test_*` definitions under tests/;
                                      no test execution or pass/fail result
  docs/missions/<name>.md      — the "Activation load" callout, measured by
                                 scripts/validate.py's transitive_load (issue #276)

The README references these via a shields ENDPOINT badge
(https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=<raw>/docs/assets/badges/<name>.json), and the
version badge reads .claude-plugin/plugin.json directly via a shields DYNAMIC
badge — so no count lives in hand-written prose or in the badge markup.

`scripts/validate.py` calls `check()` and fails CI if a committed file is stale
(someone added a mission without regenerating). Run this to refresh:

    python3 scripts/gen-badges.py                    # write every surface a PR keeps current
    python3 scripts/gen-badges.py --check            # exit 1 if any of those is stale
    python3 scripts/gen-badges.py --release          # the release cut: also the test count
    python3 scripts/gen-badges.py --check --release  # the cut's check: the test count too

The test count is the one exception (CI speed and bookkeeping change). Every PR changed it, so
every PR rewrote docs/assets/badges/tests.json and conflicted with every other open PR. It is now the
inventory AT THE LAST RELEASE: only `--release` writes it, the release cut runs that, and the
README badge is labelled "at last release", so between releases it shows an older number under a
label that says so, never a stale one presented as current. Between releases CI holds it to its
shape (an "N in source" inventory, never a pass/fail claim) and nothing more.
