"""certification.py — validate and render the provider/harness certification record (#596).

`runtime/providers/certification.json` maps every ADVERTISED route to the strongest evidence
that exists for it, so "supported" can never again mean only "an adapter exists":

  provider cells  every (provider, profile, harness) in capabilities.json's
                  supported_profiles x supported_harnesses — the matrix docs/runtimes.md
                  advertises;
  harness cells   every (harness, profile) of the shared launch table
                  (runtime/providers/base.py build_harness_command), ro and rw.

A cell carries a tier, the exact upstream version or commit it was certified against (null is
rendered `unknown` and is never guessed), evidence paths, and explicit limitations. Tiers:

  live-witnessed  a real upstream build and a real harness ran the route; bound run report.
  fixture-tested  the fleet's code for the route runs in CI against an in-repo fixture (a
                  scripted upstream transport or an inert worker): proves our side only.
  source-only     the launch was written from upstream source or docs; nothing drives it.
  unsupported     the fleet refuses the route before any launch, with a typed refusal.
  unavailable     advertised, but no evidence of any kind exists here: state unknown.

Checks (`check`, the default) — each failure is one `FAIL:` line:
  1. shape: schema_version, record_version, exactly the five tiers, known keys only;
  2. coverage: each provider's route groups partition its advertised matrix exactly (a cell
     missing, doubled or not advertised fails), and the harness groups partition
     SUPPORTED_HARNESSES x {ro, rw};
  3. evidence: every path resolves under --root; `path::Name` must define `class Name` or
     `def Name` there; every group states at least one limitation;
  4. live-witnessed: needs `witnessed` (upstream_version, harness_version, host, date, route), an
     exact upstream version, and a docs/runs/*.md report whose RUN: header records verifier=GREEN
     at a self-run/external-run tier and which BINDS under run_report.py's check_report — the check
     scripts/validate.py applies to proof_evidence (it re-hashes the inventory at the pinned
     commit, so it needs full git history, like validate.py). `route` quotes whole lines of that
     run's inventoried artifacts, read at its inventory_at, which must NAME every cell of the
     group: provider, PROFILE=<p> beside the harness, and the recorded versions;
  5. unsupported: needs the typed `refusal` code the route is refused with;
  6. freshness: a provider bound to a pin (`upstream.pin` = `<file>#<key>`) is STALE once the
     pin's commit, version or live_receipts.version differs from `certified_against`. Every
     cell of that provider then reads `stale` — never its recorded tier — and the check fails
     until a maintainer rechecks the cells and re-records `certified_against`.

Usage:
  certification.py [check]  [--root DIR] [--record FILE] [--pins FILE]
  certification.py matrix   [--json] [--root DIR] [--record FILE] [--pins FILE]
  certification.py markdown [--root DIR] [--record FILE] [--pins FILE]
`--pins` previews a re-pin: point it at the candidate pins file to list the cells it voids.

Exit: 0 valid and fresh · 1 invalid or stale (matrix/markdown still print) · 2 unreadable / usage.
