# is unset and hooks/hooks.json never fires: the recommended install path ships

# this clone's absolute path substituted, ready to merge into settings.json.

# The path is substituted by python3 into the PARSED template, never by sed into its text:
# sed escaping covered `&` and `|` (#382) but not `\` or `"`, and a clone path carrying
# either emitted invalid JSON. Each placeholder-led path is shell-quoted inside the command
# string (the host runs it through a shell, so a space or `$` in the path would split or
# expand), then json.dumps encodes the string — both layers escaped by their own encoder.
