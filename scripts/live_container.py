"""live_container.py — the container-based live harness: ONE paid live arm in a fresh, disposable
Linux container beside a credential broker in its own, both destroyed after (PR #668;
docs/guides/live-harness.md is the operator's guide).

  build   build the harness image from scripts/live_container.Dockerfile: the base pinned by
          digest, git, and Claude Code pinned to one version by its official installer, installed
          as the non-root user every arm runs as (the only step that downloads anything)
  run     run one arm in a fresh container of that image and destroy it:
              wip_curve     scripts/wip_curve.py ARGS
              ablation      scripts/ablation.py ARGS
              hint_replay   scripts/hint_replay.py ARGS
              trajectories  scripts/eval.py run --suite trajectories ARGS
              first_run     runtime/scripts/first_run.py ARGS
          ARGS follow `--`; inside the container the repository is /repo (read-only) and the
          results directory is /results, the working directory, where every output must go: an
          arm's output flag (OUTPUTS) must name a path under it, and an arm whose ledger defaults
          to a temp dir must name one (REQUIRED)

Why a container. Process containment (runtime/scripts/containment.py) finds every process of a
paid call by the OF_CALL_ID marker in its environment. On macOS no sweep can see every
descendant: an Apple system binary's environment is hidden from `ps -E`. So every paid live path
refuses on a plain host, and lifts only inside a container this launcher started (containment.
harness_problem): a container marker, the launcher's attestation whose nonce is the container's
own hostname, and the strong probe passing, which it does on Linux. Destroying the container is
the final backstop for anything in-process containment misses, a process that clears its own
environment included.

The token never enters the arm's container (Codex at 47e0616eac: its uid runs the agents and the
tests they write, so any of them could read a token mounted there). It is mounted read-only
(SECRET) into a second container that runs scripts/live_broker.py alone, the credential broker.
The arm's container joins the broker's network namespace and nothing else; its `claude`
(scripts/live_container_bin/claude, first on PATH) sends every model call to the broker, which
puts the token in place of a placeholder and refuses any call that would pass --cap-usd. The
broker's ledger is written beside the receipt, out of the arm's reach, and summarised in it.

What the arm's container gets: the image's non-root user, --rm, a pids/memory/CPU limit, no
capability, no-new-privileges, no privileged flag, no host namespace, and the broker's network
alone -- which includes the broker's route out, so the arm's own connections reach any host
unmetered: the broker caps model calls, it is no egress control (W5-15); a clean export of the
checkout's HEAD, read-only (the launcher refuses a dirty tree, and
nothing the container writes reaches the checkout, its .git or its ignored files); one read-write
results directory, so the arm's own ledger and evidence outlive the container; and the
attestation, read-only. The broker's container gets the same user, hardening and export, limits
of its own, the token file read-only, and its ledger directory. One launch at a time holds LOCK,
from the leftover check to the receipt. A wall-clock limit ends it: the launcher kills and removes
both containers, then verifies with `docker ps -a --filter label=LABEL=<nonce>` that neither
exists. A teardown step that fails or times out is recorded, never raised, so the receipt,
written outside every mount, is always written. The container's output is saved through a
redactor to a 0600 file: no byte of the token reaches the disk. The image must be one this
launcher's `build` recorded (IMAGES: its id and the Dockerfile digest it was built from) AND carry
the committed Dockerfile's digest label, unless --allow-foreign-image names the exception, which
the receipt records (W5-13): a label alone is inherited by any image built FROM this one. The
committed digest is always the git object's (the pinned commit's for a launch, HEAD's for a build,
which refuses a working copy that differs), never the file on disk's. Both
guard against accidents; docker access is root-equivalent and can forge either. Every path that
goes into a --mount, derived staging paths included, passes one
rule: no comma, quote or line break (W5-14).

The limit, honestly: this guards against accidents on the host, never against an operator who
deliberately fakes a container (as root: a /.dockerenv, an attestation, a hostname). The
attestation proves which launch a container came from to the receipt, not to an adversary.

Exit: the arm's exit status, once both containers are verified destroyed · 2 usage or a refused
start (whatever was created is destroyed first) · 3 a container could not be verified destroyed
(fail closed) · 124 the wall-clock limit ended it (verified destroyed) · 128+N on signal N
(verified destroyed).
