"""Content-free, hash-chained receipts for everything the fleet sends off-repo.

The run-close integrity inventory hashes what the fleet PRODUCED. Nothing
records what it SENT. This ledger is the second half: one line per off-repo
write the fleet performs -- opening a PR, posting a comment, closing an issue,
triggering a deploy, creating a schedule -- appended BEFORE the send.

Status, stated first because it bounds what this is worth today: doctrine now names it —
merge-serialization.md requires every coordinator off-repo write to be preceded by
``egress.py write … &&`` (#368) — but no automated sink calls it yet beyond merge_queue.py,
which writes this receipt itself before each merge it sends (#599). Every other receipt is
written by a coordinator that follows the policy by hand. Read every sentence below as what it
records once called, not as a guarantee a daemon enforces.

Threat model, stated because it bounds what this is worth even then: the
ledger is forensic observability, not an exfiltration control. It records ATTEMPTED
egress so an accident is auditable afterwards. Anything with a shell can send
without a receipt; the point is that the fleet's own sinks cannot do so
silently.

Record (format v2: one canonical JSON object per line, mode 0600)::

    {"v": 2, "id", "ts", "sink", "host", "payload_class", "bytes",
     "payload_sha256", "consent", "prev"}

* **Where.** ``<repository root>/.orca/egress.jsonl`` -- the root is the nearest directory at or
  above the working directory holding ``.git``, so a send from a subdirectory lands in the same
  ledger; outside a repository the default refuses, and so does a root nested in another
  repository unless it is a linked worktree of it (whose own ledger is then named on stderr): a
  planted or vendored ``.git`` never moves it silently. ``--ledger``, ``$OPEN_FLEET_EGRESS_LEDGER``
  or ``$ORCA_EGRESS_LEDGER`` name another file, and ``write`` then says so on stderr (as it does
  when the path resolves through a symlink): a receipt never lands elsewhere silently. Only the
  ledger's own directory is created, never a tree above it. And ``verify`` never passes on no
  receipts (no ledger file, or an empty one: exit 4) unless the caller says none were expected.
* **Content-free.** Never the payload text: a sha256 of the exact bytes sent
  and a byte count, and a ``payload_class`` that describes the KIND of thing
  sent ("pr-body", "issue-comment"). ``payload_sha256`` is null when a
  subprocess owns the bytes and the fleet never saw them. Text fields are printable ASCII on
  every line, legacy ones included, ``consent`` written now names a grant (letters, digits,
  `` ._:/#()@+,=-``), and everything printed has its control characters escaped.
* **Every byte bound.** ``id`` is the sha256 of the record's canonical serialisation without
  ``id`` (fixed key order, ``","``/``":"`` separators, ASCII escapes), and a line must BE the
  canonical serialisation of exactly these keys: an extra key, a re-spaced line, a string where
  ``bytes`` is an integer, a blank line or a missing final newline is refused, on the last line as
  on any other. ``prev`` is the sha256 of the previous raw line (``""`` on line 1), so any edit
  to an earlier line breaks every later one.
* **Anchors, because a chain only proves continuity with A genesis.** A ledger deleted and
  rewritten from scratch links perfectly to its own new genesis (#312), and every receipt written
  since the last anchor can be rewritten with a recomputed ``id``. So an anchor is kept where the
  writer cannot reach it and handed back to ``verify``: the head digest ``head`` prints (run
  close records it), and the ``id`` every ``write`` prints to its caller -- either names one line
  byte for byte, and with it everything before it. ``--expect-ancestor`` (repeatable) requires
  each anchored line still in the chain; ``--expect-head`` requires the ledger to end there.
  Unanchored, the output says so rather than reading as a clean bill.
* **Fail-closed on write.** A sink that cannot write its receipt must not
  send. ``write`` exits 3 in that case, so the caller's ``&&`` stops. It reads the ledger through
  the descriptor it holds locked, verifies every line exactly as ``verify`` does (a ledger the
  verifier would refuse is refused before the send, not discovered at close), appends, and
  fsyncs the file -- and on first creation its directory -- before printing the id.
* **Consent is a field, not a vibe.** Every receipt names the standing grant
  that authorizes the send; ``grants`` verifies the chain, then lists them so a human can see what
  the fleet believes it is allowed to do.

Migration: a ledger written before v2 (no ``"v"`` key) still verifies while each such line is
exactly what the v1 writer produced -- its keys, its canonical bytes, its types and its v1 ``id``
-- which binds every byte of it too. v1 lines are accepted only as a prefix: the first v2 receipt
chains onto the last v1 line, and a v1 line after a v2 one is refused. A legacy line the v1 writer
could not have produced (an extra key, re-spaced JSON) was never bound and now reads as TAMPER.

Subcommands
    write    verify, append one receipt, print its id (an anchor for that receipt)
    verify   recompute the whole chain, check any anchors
    head     verify, then print the chain head digest to anchor off the writer
    grants   verify, then list the distinct consents, with sink/host and use counts

Exit codes
    0  ok (``verify``: the chain is intact)
    2  usage -- a missing or malformed argument
    3  fail-closed: the receipt could not be written, the ledger fails verification, or a
       ``verify`` anchor (``--expect-head`` / ``--expect-ancestor``) did not match. Never treat a 3
       as permission to send.
    4  ``verify`` found no receipts (no ledger file, or an empty one): never a pass unless the
       caller said none were expected (``--allow-empty``, or ``--expect-head "(empty)"``).

How to wire
    Every off-repo write the coordinator itself performs is preceded by
    ``egress.py write ... && <the send>`` -- the ``&&`` is the fail-closed
    coupling, since exit 3 stops the send. ``--payload-file`` hashes the exact
    bytes about to go out (a PR body written to a file first), streamed, so a later
    dispute compares hashes rather than memories. Per-worker network egress is
    NOT covered here and cannot be without a proxy: that stays a sandbox-policy
    requirement for the disposable lane, stated rather than claimed. At run
    close, ``verify`` runs beside the integrity inventory and the two together
    answer "what did this run produce, and what left the machine".

    Example: ``egress.py write --sink pr-open --host github.com
    --payload-class pr-body --payload-file /tmp/body.md --consent
    grant:pr-open-on-base && gh pr create --body-file /tmp/body.md``
