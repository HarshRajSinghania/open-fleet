"""Record a live agent run as #602 trajectory events: the agent-command prefix of the live arms.

    python3 scripts/trajectory_harness.py [--trajectory-out PATH] [--] <agent command...>

#602's live runner (`eval.py run --suite trajectories --tier live`) and #606's paired runner
(`ablation.py run --harness-cmd ...`) both put this in front of the agent command. It:

1. prepares the cell workspace (its cwd): git-inits it when it is not a repository root, gives
   the repository a local identity with signing off, and commits the materialized state as the
   base the agent starts from;
2. runs the agent in the caller's process group, never a new one: scripts/_ablation_run.py kills
   a cell's whole group on a timeout or an interrupt, and an agent that left it would outlive its
   call. stdin is inherited; stdout is passed through byte for byte (the runners read usage from
   it) and kept; stderr is inherited;
3. as tool results stream past, snapshots the workspace's commits (`git rev-list` from the
   base, every ref and reflog) with every call started by then, so a quiet or wrapped commit is
   attributed to the one shell call that can have made it, and refused when two could;
4. once the agent exits, turns the kept Claude stream-json into #602 events
   (scripts/_trajectories.py, record_stream) and writes them to $ABLATION_OUT/trajectory.jsonl,
   or to --trajectory-out when ABLATION_OUT is unset. A destination is required before the agent
   starts, and a stale recording there is removed first, so a run that records nothing leaves
   nothing to be graded. When the recorder refuses (a commit it cannot attribute, a history it
   cannot replay in order), no recording is written and `<destination>.refused` says why;
5. exits with the agent's exit code (128+N when signal N ended it).

Git isolation. The agent's environment points GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL and GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM at the null
device and drops every other GIT_* variable (GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS and GIT_CONFIG_COUNT pairs
inject config too), so the operator's ~/.gitconfig and system config are never read. The
workspace's own config sets commit and tag signing off and names `false` as every signing
program, and GNUPGHOME is an empty directory with no SSH agent socket. A commit the agent makes
is unsigned; one it forces with -S fails rather than reach the operator's key.

Stdlib only. Writes nothing outside the workspace, its private GNUPGHOME and the recording.
