"""Live runner for the adversarial trajectory suite's model-dependent arm (#602).

Library: the CLI is eval.py's (`run --suite trajectories --tier live`), loaded by path the way
eval.py loads _trajectories.py. For each selected case and repeat it materializes the case's
pinned initial state fresh, runs the operator's agent command under scripts/trajectory_harness.py
with the case's allowed tools as that call's allowlist and its own spend limit, grades the
recording with the existing replay (eval.py run_trajectory_eval, an unpinned recording), and
writes results.json and report.md.

What runs live, and what does not
    Without --live-adapters, a live cell delivers an injection two ways, in the task prompt
    (issue text) and as a file in the workspace (a repository document), and every other case is
    UNRUN: the 2026-10-25 design, reproduced exactly. With --live-adapters it delivers each
    arrival the way the fleet does (arrival_plan):
    - issue text, in the task prompt;
    - a repository document, as a file in the workspace that the task points the worker at;
    - tool output, as the output of a `ci-log` command on the agent's PATH, which prints the CI
      log the case's pinned recording carries through guard_text.py's trust envelope;
    - recalled memory, as the episodic hint search_sessions.py --episodic-hint builds, in the
      task prompt as the fleet's pre-dispatch packet carries it;
    - a retry handover, as the packet watchdog.py --handover builds from the attempt record in
      the case's pinned recording. That first attempt is the fixture; the live call is the retry.
    The grader replays a composed recording: the recall, or the fixture's first attempt, ahead of
    the live events, so the arrival is checked on the case's own surface. A case is UNRUN, with
    the reason, and is never run or graded, when its tool output comes from somewhere other than
    CI, its handover would be withheld (no retry is dispatched), or it does not grant Read (a
    live worker cannot edit a file it may not read). `--all-live` is the declared design: every
    live_cases row's replayed case plus every benign and clean control.

The spend guard is #606's (scripts/_ablation_run.py), reused rather than re-implemented
    - no explicit --cost-cap-usd, no run;
    - PRE-EMPTIVE: a call starts only if the ledger's count so far plus the call's full
      reservation fits within the cap;
    - each call is handed its own limit (--max-budget-usd at --limit-fraction of its reservation);
    - the spend ledger in the output directory is fsynced with the full reservation before the
      call starts and settled after it, so an interrupted or killed call stays charged in full
      and a later run into the same directory counts it against its own cap;
    - a call is charged its measured total_cost_usd, or its full reservation when it was killed
      or reported no cost;
    - a measured call above its reservation stops the run (the limit did not hold), and so does
      a call that reported no cost;
    - each call runs under #657's watchdog (contained_run), leading its own process group with
      the harness keeping the agent in it, and tagged OF_CALL_ID: a timeout, a leader that exits
      leaving children, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, Ctrl-C or the runner's own death kills the call whole,
      and a call something of which survives (or that discovery cannot see) is never settled:
      it stays charged in full and the run stops;
    - a live run refuses to start where process discovery cannot contain a call (#657's
      containment_problem).

NOT evidence. results.json says `live-unreviewed`: no live cell leaves UNRUN in the published
